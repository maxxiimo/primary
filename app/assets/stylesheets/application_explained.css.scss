/* DEFINITIONS
  ============================================================================ */
@import "define";

// Use the "Definitions" section to set global variables for the entire project
// such as $base-font or $base-font-size.


/* MIXINS
  ============================================================================ */
@import "compass";
@import "mixins";

// Major mixins such as Compass and homebrewed mixins.


/* RESETS
  ============================================================================ */
@import "boilerplate/h5bp_normalize_v303";

// To counter normalize indentation of lists, and reposition bullets and numbers.
ol, ul {
  padding-left: 0;
  list-style-position: inside
}

// The granddaddy of all resets is Eric Meyer's "Reset CSS". Sometimes I use
// compass' reset utilities which are based on Eric Meyer's work, but my preference
// is to use Normalize.css through HTML5 boilerplate. You can find Eric Meyer's and
// both the original Normalize.css and HTML 5 Boilerplate's normalize styles here
// (a few converted to sass for you):
//

/* BASIC STRUCTURE
  ============================================================================ */
@import "susy";
@import "desktop/layout";

// Use the "Basic Structure" section to style major elements and component areas
// such as html and body tags, or header and footer areas.


/* TYPOGRAPHY
  ============================================================================ */
@import "desktop/typography";

// Use the "Typography" section to style major typographical elements such as
// paragraphs, fonts, links, etc. These typographical styles are standard across
// all pages unless redefined in subsequent partials.


/* MISCELLANEOUS
  ============================================================================ */
@import "misc";
@import "animations";

// "Miscellaneous" is a catchall for miscellaneous partials and styles that should
// appear earlier on in the stylesheet. "misc" has an assortment of general helper
// styles; "animations" obviously is for animations that apply generally.


/* NAVIGATION
  ============================================================================ */
@import "desktop/navigation";

// "Navigation" could be part of another section, or even contained within another
// partial, however, experiences has proven that a lot of styling can happen in
// navigation. Navigation styles can become quite large, and there can be more than
// one navigation design or user driven type.


/* FORMS
  ============================================================================ */
@import "desktop/forms";

// Add all your form styles here.


/* PAGES
  ============================================================================ */
@import "desktop/pages";

// "Pages" will hold the bulk of your code, i.e. each page or functional area of
// your application. You can organize them all within one partial, separate them
// into their own partials, or a combination of both. I tend to add common
// functionality between pages in the root _pages.sass partial, then import more
// specific page partials into _pages.sass.


/* STAGING - new styles for front-end folks to review and integrate
  ============================================================================ */
@import "desktop/staging";

// The "staging" section is a staging area for code that need to be brought into
// the main stylesheets. It's designed to allow specific individual/s to be
// gatekeepers for code entering the main body of stylesheets. This ensures that
// stylesheets remain organized, DRY, follow the stylesheet standards, and at a
// bare minimum provide a form of quality control.


/* APPLICATION - ad hoc code under this line
  ============================================================================ */

// "Application" could be a place for anything that did not fit in anywhere else
// and doesn't need to take precedence.


/* LAST
  ============================================================================ */
@import "boilerplate/h5bp_helpers";
@import "boilerplate/h5bp_print";

// "Last" is a reminder that those styles *need* to appear last.
