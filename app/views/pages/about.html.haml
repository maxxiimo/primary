    %h2 This is our mission, and an important one. Each and every member of Primary Code takes this charge seriously.
    %p Our classrooms are located in the heart of West Palm Beach, within blocks from all major attractions and amenities. This provides our students with a rich and fun environment for building lifelong friendships and collaboration networks.
    %p A strong foundation in coding is paramount and our programs are intensive and provide this, but it is also important for students to belong to a network in which to flourish from once they graduate. Our curriculum is designed to foster teamwork and collaboration, and we take advantage of our location in West Palm Beach Florida to do the same.
    %p Primary Code is dedicated to your success and to improving the world through technology. If you're looking for a career in programming, come check us out at one of our many open houses or coding meet ups.
    %p We look forward to meeting you.
